# Pr0j3ct

It's a simple game written in Java using Swing (coz this is a [University Projectâ„¢](http://ii.us.edu.pl/)) where your mission is to shoot everything (or more precisely - fruits) that appears on the game canvas before it manages to fly to the other side. And that's it!
The game window is resizable, and even though the same amount of fruits is generated regardless of the window size, bigger window sizes don't make this game easier at all (IMO).

This is how it looks (if everything works :>):
